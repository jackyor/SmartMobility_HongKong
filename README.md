## scenario

## input data preperation
### network: osm
First, download map file of Hong Kong from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
Then, follow the intrustion in [pt2matsim](https://github.com/matsim-org/pt2matsim) to create a network. 
If public transport is needed to be included in the model, it also can use to create multimodel network and transit schedule that used for simlulating public transport in MATSim.

### plan: tcs
process + script
The MATSim plan file represents a synthesis population generated from the data of the [Travel Characteristics Survey 2011](https://www.td.gov.hk/en/publications_and_press_releases/publications/free_publications/travel_characteristics_survey_2011_final_report/index.html) and [census 2021](https://www.census2021.gov.hk/en/index.html) .
Since the model did not access to the detailed data of both sources, the synthesis population is generated from general parameter in tcs2011 and census 2021.
